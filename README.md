# Carnet: Bureaucracy for Cargo

> **IMPORTANT NOTICE**:   Carnet is pre-alpha software. Sandboxing works. 
> Crate authentication is not ready yet. Identity and key 
> life-cycle management are WIH.

Carnet is a small tool that imposes additional security constraints 
on Rust's official package manager, Cargo. This tool aims to prevent 
or otherwise limit the damage malicious crates can cause. 
                     
Carnet imposes two types of security constraints on Cargo:
    
1. It can isolate Cargo to a separate system-enforced 
   sandbox, only allowing access to a limited subset of 
   system resources.

2. It can authenticate crates before allowing Cargo to 
   operate on them. (This feature is incomplete and should 
   not be used yet.)

Carnet is meant as a temporary solution until Cargo gains the ability to 
impose these constraints on its own.

## Installing & Updating

If your system is compatible with the FHS standard, you can install 
Carnet system-wide by downloading this repository and running the 
following command at the root of the repository: 


```sh
sudo install ./carnet /usr/local/bin/carnet
```

Alternatively, you can install Carnet to your user's `bin` directory
by running the following command in the root of this repository if 
your system is configured to respect the XDG standard:

```sh
install ./carnet ~/.local/bin
```

Carnet requires the following dependencies to be installed on your 
system:

- A modern version of GNU Bash (>= 4.4, 2016)
- GNU Core Utilities
- Bubblewrap (`bwrap`)
- OpenSSL CLI Tool (`openssl`)
- Tiny C Compiler (`tcc`)


## Using Carnet 
    
Carnet can be used in place of Cargo, transparently accepting all
its arguments:

```sh
carnet test
carnet build --release
```

In both the commands above, Carnet will first verify the 
authenticity of the crate and then run the corresponding cargo 
command in a restrictive sandbox (unless configured otherwise). 
This sandbox prevents Cargo from accessing the network, most of 
the user's home directory, most of the filesystem, and so on 
by default.

Sandbox restrictions can be relaxed easily and can even be disabled
entirely by simply passing the appropriate flag to Carnet:

```sh
carnet --unsandbox-network     ...
carnet --unsandbox-cargo-home  ...
carnet --unsandbox-processes   ...
carnet --unsandbox-session     ...
carnet --unsandbox-filesystem  ...
... and so on.
```

In addition to general flags that act on entire resource classes,
Carnet can also expose individual files and directories within 
the sandbox via the flags `--carnet:ro-paths` and 
`--carnet:rw-paths`.

To avoid ambiguity, flags intended for Carnet can be prefixed 
with `carnet:` while flags intend for Cargo can be prefixed with 
`cargo:`. If both Carnet and Cargo accept the same flag and 
prefixes are not used, the handling of this flag is unspecified. 
The following example illustrates the use of both prefixes:

```sh
carnet --carnet:unsandbox-network test --cargo:release
```

Both the sandboxing of Cargo and the automatic verification of crates 
can be disabled, for a single invocation or persistently, through the 
use of the appropreate flag or by disabling the feature in Carnet's 
configuration settings:

```sh
carnet --disable-sandbox       ...
carnet --disable-verification  ...

carnet disable sandbox
carnet disable verification
```

Run `carnet carnet:help` or `carnet --carnet:help` for more 
information.


## History & Future Plans

We originally wrote this version of Carnet to only serve as a 
prototype for when we wanted to implement Carnet more robustly 
(in Rust). However, we ultimately decided against this approach and 
published Carnet as-is. Our decision was in part because we couldn't 
guarantee when this rewrite would occur. We also hope to gather 
enough feedback to help us make a better Carnet when the rewrite 
eventually takes place.


## Feedback is Important

Since we don't include any telemetry in Carnet, we rely on your 
feedback to gauge how successful this project is. If you use Carnet 
and don't mind sharing this fact publicly, let us know by leaving a 
comment on the Github issue here:
